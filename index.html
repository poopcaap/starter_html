            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src="images/Max.png" width = "400" alt="Max1111111">
            <p>Max the Golden Retriever is a 5-year-old bundle of sunshine with a heart as golden as his coat. His fur glistens like freshly polished brass under the warm sunlight, and it's as soft as a cloud to the touch. His expressive, almond-shaped eyes are the color of rich, melted caramel, always sparkling with a playful curiosity that's impossible to resist.</p> 
            <P>Standing at an impressive 24 inches tall at the shoulder, Max carries himself with an air of gentle dignity that belies his goofy and lovable nature. His well-muscled body is the embodiment of strength and agility, yet his graceful movements make him seem almost weightless as he bounds through life with unbridled enthusiasm.</P>

            <img src="images/classic_juno.JPG" width = "400" alt="Juno00000000000000000">
            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size, hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p>
            <p>One of Junoâ€™s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics. </p>            <!-- Colleen van Lent -->
